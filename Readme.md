# crud

__Crud-functionality for mongoose and express__


## Install

    Î» npm install crud


## Usage

    var express = require('express')
      , app = express.createServer()
      , models = require('./models')

    require('crud')

    app.crud('modelname')

## REST-api

The action-mapping is inherited from
[express-resource](https://github.com/visionmedia/express-resource)
and is as follows

    GET     /forums              ->  index
    GET     /forums/new          ->  new
    POST    /forums              ->  create
    GET     /forums/:forum       ->  show
    GET     /forums/:forum/edit  ->  edit
    PUT     /forums/:forum       ->  update
    DELETE  /forums/:forum       ->  destroy


## Roadmap

Crud is not nearly at a finite-state, but will be under heavy development and
testing in the near future. There's no official roadmap per se, but you can
assume that these features will be implemented shortly:

* Automatic and manual messages (using express-messages)
* More validation on the client-side
* Setting/retrieving values via sockets
